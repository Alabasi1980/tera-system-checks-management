# Tera Active Context

## Purpose

This file is the startup handoff for new sessions in this ongoing project.

It is intentionally short.
It does not replace the official source files.

Use it to start fast, then open only the needed official files.

## Session Start Rule

For any new session in this project:

1. Read this file first.
2. Then read only the files needed for the current task.
3. Do not reopen all system/project files unless there is a conflict, ambiguity, review need, or explicit user request.

## Current Project Status

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Project | Checks Management App |
| Size | Small MVP |
| Runtime | OpenCode |
| Approved Tech | Next.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma |
| Current Phase | Phase 4 active — Banks Screen S03 complete ✅ |
| Next Task | `TASK-0008` — Parties Screen (S04) |
| Current Lead Agent | `Tera Agent` |
| Expected Execution Agent | `EngineeringAgent` |

## Last Closed Tasks

## Recent System Changes

- `2026-06-27`: **EngineeringAgent refactored** — split into EngineeringAgent (Backend/Logic) + FrontendAgent (UI/Styling)
- `2026-06-27`: **FrontendAgent created** — responsible for all page.tsx, components, CSS, RTL, enforcing 28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md
- `2026-06-27`: **QAAndAcceptanceAgent, DocumentationHandoverAgent, ReportingAnalyticsAgent** — pre-generated for future phases
- `2026-06-27`: **Defense-in-depth upgrade** — `requireAdmin()` added to `lib/auth.ts`; all Banks Server Actions now verify ADMIN role before executing. Pattern for all future actions.

## Active Rules You Must Not Miss

- Read `project-preparation/PROJECT_RULES.md` before creating, approving, or delegating any new task.
- `Pre-Execution Gate: PASS` is required before any implementation delegation.
- `Post-Execution Review Gate` is required before `Accepted` or `Closed`.
- Real secrets are allowed only in approved local environment files or local environment variables.
- Never write real secrets into task files, logs, handbacks, or config/code fallback values.
- Post-execution review must also inspect the core `project-control/` files, not only application code.
- If a secret appears in any task file, log, report, or control record, the task cannot PASS review.
- After each implementation task, decide whether `ProjectControlAgent`, `SecurityAgent`, or `QAAndAcceptanceAgent` must perform an independent follow-up review.
- Do not assume that only the currently active sub-agents are available; Tera may generate an additional agent later when needed.
- New sub-agents start in `generated-agents/opencode/` and become active only after specialization plus copy into `.opencode/agents/`.
- After activating a new sub-agent in `.opencode/agents/`, Tera must ask for environment restart.
- Project-control IDs must stay unique and sequential.
- Use only the smallest relevant context for the current task.

## Active Decisions / Important Notes

- `DEC-0004` — Secret handling and redaction rules are active across the system.
- `DEC-0005` — `TERA_ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` is now the first startup file for ongoing sessions.
- `DEC-0006` — SecurityAgent independent review required before next phase ✅ (fulfilled — TASK-0005 complete).
- `DEC-0007` — Post-execution review must inspect core `project-control` files and include an explicit independent-review decision when relevant.
- `DEC-0008` — EngineeringAgent split into Backend/Logic; FrontendAgent owns UI/Styling.
- `DEC-0009` — Selected generated agents are now active in `.opencode/agents/` for faster delegation.
- `DEC-0010` — Unified sub-agent lifecycle: needed now vs likely later, draft first, activate only after specialization, restart after activation.
- `DEC-0011` — `requireAdmin()` added to all Banks Server Actions for defense in depth. Pattern applies to all future actions.
- `ISSUE-0003` — Secret exposure incident from TASK-0003 was resolved; do not reintroduce secrets into docs or config fallbacks.

## Available Sub-Agents

| Agent | Use |
|---|---|
| `EngineeringAgent` | Backend/Logic: actions.ts, Prisma, Auth, Middleware, DB, Config (NOT UI) |
| `FrontendAgent` | UI/Styling: page.tsx, components, CSS, RTL, enforcing 28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md |
| `ProjectControlAgent` | Updating task/log/decision/issue records under Tera direction |
| `SecurityAgent` | Independent follow-up review for Auth, Secrets, Permissions, Middleware, and Config tasks |
| `QAAndAcceptanceAgent` | Independent follow-up review for UI, Workflow, and acceptance checks |
| `RequirementsScopeAgent` | Scope review only when scope changes |
| `BusinessWorkflowAgent` | Workflow review only when business process changes |
| `DataDesignAgent` | Data review only when schema/business data design changes |
| `UIUXStructureAgent` | UI structure review only when screen/design scope changes |
| `DocumentationHandoverAgent` | Delivery documentation, user manual, deployment notes |
| `ReportingAnalyticsAgent` | Report specifications (e.g., check register/kashf) before EngineeringAgent implements |

Activation note:
- The list above shows the currently active agents only.
- Tera may activate additional agents later if a real need appears.

## Read Next Only If Needed

- Current task details: `project-control/tasks/TASK-0007.md` (Banks Screen) or next task `project-control/tasks/TASK-0008.md` (Parties Screen)
- Compact official project memory: `project-control/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Active rules: `project-preparation/PROJECT_RULES.md`
- Plan details: `project-preparation/09_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Auth/roles requirements: `project-preparation/04_USERS_ROLES_PERMISSIONS.md`
- UI/login guidance: `project-preparation/07_SCREENS_AND_UI_STRUCTURE.md`
- UI style guide: `project-preparation/28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md`

## Update Rules

- Keep this file short and practical.
- Do not copy full logs or long execution notes here.
- Do not store secrets here.
- Update it after each important task or when a phase closes.
