## Activity Log

## [2026-06-29] - SYSTEM_VERIFICATION: Full 1-6 phase consistency review

- Related Task: N/A (System Maintenance)
- Actor: Tera Agent
- Summary: Performed full consistency review across `.opencode/agents/tera.md`, `TeraAgent.md`, `TERA_RUNTIME_CHECKLISTS.md`, `TERA_RUNTIME_TEMPLATES.md`, `Tera_Project_Preparation_Files.md`, `TERA_PROJECT_DECISION.md`, `TeraPolicyMap.md`, `TERA_RUNTIME_PROTOCOLS.md`, `TeraPreExecutionGate.md`, `TASK_TEMPLATE.md`, and `TERA_USER_GUIDE.md`. Verified final phase order, phase outputs, TASK-PREP/TASK-COD distinction, project-control vs project-preparation output boundaries, execution batch linkage, and Post-Execution Review flow. Fixed remaining boundary wording in `.opencode/agents/tera.md` and `TERA_USER_GUIDE.md` so analysis/preparation content stays in `project-preparation/` while control/planning/task records belong in `project-control/`. Search confirmed no remaining old terms: `Project Preparation Files Generation`, `Sub-Agent Generation & Delegation`, `Required / Optional`, `5-6. Execution`, old default phase order.
- Decision / Result: Final 1-6 phase workflow is consistent enough for controlled use. Minor future improvement: add optional stress-test scenarios for the final 6-phase workflow.
- Next Action: If user approves, proceed to system stress test or begin applying the workflow to a real project.

## [2026-06-29] - SYSTEM_STRUCTURE: Phase 6 documented (Implementation Cycle)

- Related Task: N/A (System Maintenance)
- Actor: Tera Agent (with expert review)
- Summary: Compared expert analysis for Phase 6 with Tera analysis and documented the final Implementation cycle. Updated `TeraAgent.md` with Phase 6 inputs, 10-step execution flow, outputs, and governing rules. Expanded `TERA_RUNTIME_CHECKLISTS.md` Phase 6 from 2 steps to an 11-step implementation checklist. Strengthened `project-control/tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` with Execution Report / Agent Handback, Tera Review, Post-Execution Review Result, and Final Tera Decision sections. Updated `TeraPreExecutionGate.md` to clarify the difference between Post-Execution Gate result (PASS / NEEDS_FIX / BLOCKED) and final Tera task decision (Accepted / Needs Fix / Blocked / Rework Needed / Deferred / Cancelled). Synced `.opencode/agents/tera.md` phase discipline and Last Synced summary.
- Decision / Result: Phase 6 is now explicitly defined as controlled execution of approved `TASK-COD-*` only, with mandatory handback, Post-Execution Review, registry updates, and no next task until the current one is accepted or explicitly handled.
- Next Action: Run final full 1-6 phase consistency review before using Build Mode.

## [2026-06-29] - SYSTEM_CORRECTION: Phase 1-4 audit fixes applied

- Related Task: N/A (System Maintenance)
- Actor: Tera Agent (with expert review)
- Summary: Applied expert review corrections for phases 1-4 and added one runtime-priority correction from Tera audit. Fixed Phase 4 wording in `TERA_RUNTIME_CHECKLISTS.md` to clarify preparation-file delegation only (`TASK-PREP-XXX`) and no application implementation. Renumbered checklist steps so each phase starts from 1. Updated `Tera_Project_Preparation_Files.md` to use `Sub-Agent Generation & Preparation Delegation` and split Phase 5 Execution Planning from Phase 6 Implementation. Updated `TERA_PROJECT_DECISION.md` from Optional to Conditional and corrected Phase 4 name. Updated `TeraAgent.md` Phase 4 task wording to `TASK-PREP-XXX`. Synced `.opencode/agents/tera.md` Phase Discipline to the final 6-phase workflow. Updated `TeraPolicyMap.md`, `TERA_RUNTIME_PROTOCOLS.md`, `TeraPreExecutionGate.md`, and `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` to include execution batch and task-type distinctions. Fixed broken Markdown fences in `TERA_RUNTIME_TEMPLATES.md`.
- Decision / Result: Phases 1-4 are now aligned and the preparation-vs-implementation boundary is explicit.
- Next Action: Continue reviewing Phase 5 / Phase 6 only after user approval.

## [2026-06-29] - SYSTEM_FEATURE: Domain Intelligence Expansion + No-Guessing Rule

- Related Task: N/A (System Maintenance)
- Actor: Tera Agent
- Summary: Expanded Domain Intelligence Protocol (TERA_RUNTIME_PROTOCOLS.md Section 12) to cover research during Client Discovery (real-time search), structured research triggers in Smart Interview, and on-demand research at any point. Added the No-Guessing Rule: when Tera lacks source-grounded knowledge, search before assuming. Added three research depths (Quick Search, Focused Research, Deep Research). Added 🔍 research markers to 13 questions across Technical, Design, Security, and Operational domains in the Question Bank. Added research trigger checklists. Updated TeraAgent.md Section 14, .opencode/agents/tera.md, TeraPolicyMap.md, TERA_RUNTIME_CHECKLISTS.md.
- Decision / Result: All recommendations must now be research-backed. Client "لا أعرف" handled by search first, then recommend with sources. No unresearched opinions presented as reliable recommendations.
- Next Action: Test on a real project intake.

## [2026-06-29] - SYSTEM_REFINE: Expert Review Applied (Client Discovery + Assumptions)

- Related Task: N/A (System Maintenance)
