## 13. Engineering Implementation Instructions

EngineeringAgent must follow this priority order:

1. `project-preparation/28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md`
2. `project-preparation/design-source/DESIGN.md` only when referenced here
3. Existing implemented component patterns
4. `tera-system/design-system/` as fallback/reference only

If a required UI rule is missing, EngineeringAgent must raise a `Design Gap` instead of guessing.
