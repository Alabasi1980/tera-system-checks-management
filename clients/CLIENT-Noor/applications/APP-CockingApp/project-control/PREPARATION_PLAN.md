## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the complete preparation roadmap for CockingApp — a bilingual (Arabic RTL) web application for recipes with an admin dashboard, built on **Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL**.

The preparation phase transforms all approved discovery inputs, technical decisions, design references, and client-approved proposals into **structured, actionable documentation** that will serve as the single source of truth for:
- Implementation (Phase 6)
- Quality assurance and testing
- Client handover and future maintenance

**Total estimated preparation files: 19** across 7 sequential batches (~3 hours total).

---

## 2. Strategic Approach

### 2.1 Preparation Philosophy

- **Traceability**: Every preparation file must trace back to an approved decision in `01_APPLICATION_IDEA.md`, `02_TECHNICAL_CONTEXT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, or the approved `APPLICATION_PROPOSAL.html`.
- **Completeness without bloat**: 19 files is the right size for a medium project. No unnecessary screens, features, or abstractions.
- **Executable output**: Each file is written so that an implementation agent (or Tera in Phase 6) can act on it without re-interpretation.
- **Client-ready**: All files use Arabic-first, professional language suitable for client presentation when needed.

### 2.2 Execution Mode

**Recommended: Direct execution by Tera (Option A)**

Rationale:
- The project scope is well-defined and documented
- All inputs (application idea, technical context, design system, approved proposal) are complete
- Sub-agent delegation for preparation would introduce coordination overhead without proportional benefit
- Tera maintains consistency across all 19 files, reducing contradictions
- Estimated 3 hours of focused work across 7 batches is manageable

**Decision Gate**: If this plan is approved, I will proceed directly to file creation in the defined order.

### 3.2 Conditional Files — Required for This Project

| ID | File Name | Need Level | Justification |
|----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| D1 | `12_BUSINESS_RULES.md` | **Required** | Complex rules: comment pre-moderation, unique ingredient enforcement, measurement unit standardization |
| D2 | `13_REPORTS_AND_DASHBOARDS.md` | **Required** | Admin Dashboard requires KPIs, recipe statistics, comment activity |
| D3 | `15_SECURITY_AND_ACCESS_CONTROL.md` | **Required** | Admin access control, session management, API route protection |
| D4 | `21_VALIDATION_AND_ERROR_HANDLING.md` | **Required** | Multiple forms (recipe, ingredient, category) with complex validation |
| D5 | `22_DEPLOYMENT_AND_ENVIRONMENTS.md` | **Required** | On-premise deployment documented for client's server team |
| D6 | `35_ROADMAP_AND_FUTURE_PHASES.md` | **Required** | Client-approved 6-phase roadmap must be formalized |

### 3.3 Supporting Files

| ID | File Name | Need Level | Justification |
|----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| S1 | `19_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` | **Required** | Prisma schema design, migration strategy, indexing plan |
| S2 | `28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md` | **Required** | Claude design system from `getdesign.md`: colors, typography, spacing, components |
| S3 | `18_IMPORT_EXPORT_DATA.md` | Medium | PDF recipe export, potential bulk import of ingredients |
| S4 | `23_BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md` | Medium | Production backup strategy for on-premise |
| S5 | `20_API_CONTRACTS.md` | Low-Medium | API route contracts (can be embedded in `07_SCREENS_AND_UI_STRUCTURE.md`) |
| S6 | `14_INTEGRATIONS_AND_EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md` | Low | YouTube embed only — minimal documentation needed |
| S7 | `16_AUDIT_LOG_AND_ACTIVITY_TRACKING.md` | Low | Single admin — activity tracked via database timestamps |
| S8 | `17_NOTIFICATIONS_AND_ALERTS.md` | Low | No notification system in current scope |
| S9 | `24_CLIENT_REVIEW_NOTES.md` | Low | Can be merged with `ISSUES_AND_GAPS.md` |
| S10 | `25_CHANGE_REQUESTS.md` | Low | Activate only when scope change is requested |

### 3.4 Not Required Files (Explicitly Excluded)

These files were considered and intentionally excluded to prevent bloat:

| File Name | Reason for Exclusion |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `14_INTEGRATIONS_AND_EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md` | YouTube embed only — documented inline in screen specs |
| `16_AUDIT_LOG_AND_ACTIVITY_TRACKING.md` | Single admin — activity tracking via DB timestamps is sufficient |
| `17_NOTIFICATIONS_AND_ALERTS.md` | No notification system in current or planned scope |
| `20_API_CONTRACTS.md` | API contracts embedded in `07_SCREENS_AND_UI_STRUCTURE.md` instead |
| `24_CLIENT_REVIEW_NOTES.md` | Merged into `ISSUES_AND_GAPS.md` for single-point tracking |
| `25_CHANGE_REQUESTS.md` | Created only when a scope change request is formally triggered |
| `26_DEPLOYMENT_DIAGRAMS.md` | Network/comms diagrams deferred to implementation phase |
| `27_PERFORMANCE_BUDGET.md` | Not a performance-critical application; addressed in architecture |
| `29_ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES.md` | Basic accessibility covered in `28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md` |
| `30_LOCALIZATION.md` | Arabic-only (RTL) — no multi-language requirement |
| `31_CACHING_STRATEGY.md` | Deferred to implementation if performance requires it |
| `32_SEO_STRATEGY.md` | Public recipes — deferred to Phase 2 or later |
| `33_ANALYTICS_AND_MONITORING.md` | On-premise — addressed in deployment doc at high level |
| `34_ERROR_MONITORING.md` | Deferred to implementation phase |

**Principle**: If a file's content fits clearly within an existing approved file, no separate file is created.

```

| Batch | Phase | Files | Est. Time | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **1** | Foundation | C1, C2, C3, C4 | 35 min | Rules, consolidated inputs, brief, scope |
| **2** | Core Structure | C5, C6, C7 | 30 min | Modules, roles, workflows |

| **7** | Plans & Delivery | C11, C12, C13, D6 | 30 min | Implementation plan, testing, handover, roadmap |

### 4.2 File Creation Standards

Each preparation file must include:

| Section | Required? | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Header block | ✅ | File name, phase reference, version, date, author |
| Purpose | ✅ | Why this file exists |
| Content body | ✅ | The substantive content |
| Dependencies | ✅ | What files or decisions this relies on |
| Open decisions | ✅ | Any unresolved items needing user/client input |
| Approval status | ✅ | Draft / Reviewed / Approved / Superseded |

### 4.3 Quality Gates

Each batch must pass these checks before proceeding to the next:

- [ ] **Consistency Check**: All facts match across files in the batch
- [ ] **Traceability Check**: Every statement traces to an approved input
- [ ] **Arabic Language Review**: Professional, natural Arabic (no machine-translation artifacts)
- [ ] **Cross-batch Alignment**: New batch files align with already-created files

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep during preparation | Low | Medium | Strict adherence to approved scope; flag new items in `ISSUES_AND_GAPS.md` |
| Missing technical detail for on-premise deployment | Medium | High | Defer to implementation phase; note as open decision |
| Design gaps in Claude design system | Low | Medium | Document gaps in `28_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md` as `Design Gaps` |
| Client changing requirements mid-preparation | Low | High | Freeze current batch; record change request; adjust plan after approval |
| Inconsistency across 19 files | Medium | Medium | Cross-batch alignment quality gate; Tera reviews all files before Phase 4 |

---

## 6. Success Criteria

This preparation phase is complete when:

1. ✅ All **19 active files** are created with **Draft** status
2. ✅ Each file passes its batch quality gate
3. ✅ No **Critical** open issues remain in `ISSUES_AND_GAPS.md`
4. ✅ All files are cross-referenced (no contradictions)
5. ✅ Majed has reviewed the `PROJECT_RULES.md` (if applicable)
6. ✅ The project is ready for **Phase 4 / Phase 5 — Execution Planning**
