# Tera Application Question Bank

## Purpose

This is the reference question bank for the **Client Discovery and Smart Interview** process — a two-stage approach that first explores the client's idea through open conversation, then follows with adaptive structured questioning across all domains.

Tera does not ask all questions. Tera selects the right questions at the right time based on previous answers, and always starts with open listening before any structured questioning.

## How to use this bank

1. **Start with Client Discovery Mode** — open listening, understanding summary, confirmation (see `TERA_RUNTIME_PROTOCOLS.md` Section 18).
2. **Enter Smart Interview only if gaps remain** after the Discovery summary is confirmed.
3. **Select questions based on gaps** — not all domains, not all questions.
4. **When the client doesn't know** — propose a default, document as `Assumption`, do not treat as final decision.
5. **Small projects: 10–15 questions. Medium: 20–35. Complex: deeper per domain.**

## Assumption Handling

When the client cannot answer a question, use this pattern:

### Response format

```
إذا لم تكن متأكدًا، أقترح الافتراض التالي:
- الخيار الموصى به: [الخيار]
- السبب: [شرح مختصر]
- الحالة: Assumption — يحتاج تأكيد لاحق
```

### Documentation format

Record all assumptions in a table (inside `project-inputs/` or in a separate file for medium/large projects):

```text
| المجال | السؤال | افتراض تيرا | الحالة | يحتاج مراجعة قبل |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| تقني | Web/Mobile | Web App | يحتاج تأكيد | التوقيع على النطاق |
| صلاحيات | عدد الأدوار | Admin + User | يحتاج تأكيد | التنفيذ |
```

### Classification

| الحالة | المعنى |
|--------|--------|
| `مؤكد` | العميل أجاب بوضوح |
| `يحتاج تأكيد` | اقتراح Tera — لم يؤكده العميل بعد |
| `مؤجل` | العميل قال "ربما لاحقاً" |
| `غير محدد حاليًا` | لم يُطرح السؤال بعد أو العميل لم يقرر |

## 🔍 Research Triggers

Throughout the Question Bank, some questions are marked with `🔍 Research recommended`. This means:

When the client's answer to this question is unclear, uncertain, or the client defers to Tera:
1. **Search first** before proposing a default.
2. Present findings with sources.
3. Let the client choose based on research.

### When research is unavailable or inconclusive
- Document the limitation clearly.
- Present as `Unknown — needs client decision` or `Inconclusive research — proceed with caution`.
- Never present an unresearched opinion as a reliable recommendation.

### Common research triggers by domain

| Domain | Topics likely needing research |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Administrative | Competitor analysis, market standards |
| Functional | Industry-specific workflows, compliance processes |
| Data/Reporting | Standard report formats, data regulations |
| Technical | 🔍 Best libraries, frameworks, APIs, hosting providers |
| Design/UX | 🔍 Design trends, accessibility standards, UI patterns |
| Security | 🔍 Regulatory requirements, security standards |
| Operational | 🔍 Hosting providers, DevOps tools, pricing |

### Quick reference: When to search vs when to use judgment

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Client: "أي بوابة دفع تنصح؟" | 🔍 **Search** — compare options with sources |
| Client: "كم عدد المستخدمين؟ 5 فقط" | Use judgment — clear answer |
| Client: "ما أفضل قاعدة بيانات؟" | 🔍 **Search** — depends on stack, volume, budget |
| Client: "التطبيق بلاريل" | Use judgment — clear technology |
| Client: "هل أحتاج ERP؟" | 🔍 **Search** — depends on business processes |
| Client: "موظفين 10، بدون صلاحيات" | Use judgment — simple scenario |
| Client: "أحتاج استضافة في السعودية" | 🔍 **Search** — local providers, regulations |
| Client: "ما رأيك في React؟" | Use judgment — well-known technology |

## After Questions: Suggestions and Improvements Phase

Once all relevant domains have been covered and Tera has a complete picture, proceed to:

1. **Summarize understanding** — Confirm with the user/client.
2. **Identify gaps** — Any area that still needs clarification.
3. **Propose improvements** — Tera may suggest:
   - Features that improve the core goal
   - Technologies that fit the requirements
   - Simplifications or scope reductions
   - Deferrals for non-essential items
4. **Classify each suggestion** as:
   - `Recommended — Include now`
   - `Recommended — Consider for later phase`
   - `Informational — For awareness only`
   - `Deferred — Not needed for MVP`
   - `Out of scope — Does not align with goals`
5. **Document all suggestions separately** from confirmed client requirements.
6. **Final confirmation** before moving to formal preparation.

---

## Usage Rules

1. **Tera does not ask all questions.** Select the essential ones first, then deep-dive only in domains that need it.
2. **Start with Domain 1 (Administrative), Domain 2 (Functional), and Domain 4 (Technical) essentials.** These give the core picture.
3. **Analyze after each batch.** Identify gaps, dependencies, and unexpected areas before choosing the next batch.
4. **Group questions in small batches.** 4-7 questions per round is comfortable.
5. **Document answers immediately** in `project-inputs/` files.
6. **After the interview is complete**, transition to the Suggestions and Improvements phase.
7. **For external clients**, Majed acts as intermediary. Tera phrases questions for forwarding.
8. **Suggested improvements must be clearly separated** from confirmed requirements.
