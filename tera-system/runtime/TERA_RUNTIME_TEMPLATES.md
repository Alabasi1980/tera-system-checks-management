# Tera Runtime Templates

These templates are official runtime support material for Tera Agent.
Use them when the compact runtime file requests a formal output format.

Authority rule:
If this file conflicts with `.opencode/agents/tera.md`, the active runtime file wins until the conflict is reviewed and corrected.

## 1. Tera Decision

```text
Tera Decision:
System files: tera-system is read-only during project execution.
Project output path: project-preparation/
Generated agents path: generated-agents/opencode/
Files to create: ...
Files not needed now: ...
Sub-agents to generate: ...
Sub-agents not needed now: ...
Reason: ...
Next step: ...
```

## 2. Delegation Context Format

For every delegated task, specify:

```text
Task ID:
Requested Agent:
Stage:
Objective:
Context Type:
Reference Files:
Required Sections:
Allowed Write Targets:
Forbidden Files / Actions:
Token Budget: Low / Medium / High / Critical
Expected Output Limit:
Acceptance Criteria:
Return Status Required:
```

## 3. Model Capability Assessment

```text
Model Capability Assessment
Current Model: [name or "current runtime model"]
Task Complexity: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Required Reasoning: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Context Size: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Verification Difficulty: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Historical Fit: [Good/Mixed/Weak/Unknown]
Decision: [sufficient / acceptable with safeguards / stronger recommended / stronger required / split]
Reason: [short reason]
Required Safeguards: [list]
User Approval Needed: Yes / No
Notes: [short notes]
```

Rules:
- Never claim a model is guaranteed or 100% capable.
- Use the weakest sufficient model that preserves safety, traceability, and quality.
- Ask the user about stronger models only when the risk, cost, or verification difficulty justifies it.
