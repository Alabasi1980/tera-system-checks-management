# Tera Runtime Templates

These templates are official runtime support material for Tera Agent.
Use them when the compact runtime file requests a formal output format.

Authority rule:
If this file conflicts with `.opencode/agents/tera.md`, the active runtime file wins until the conflict is reviewed and corrected.

Context Type:
Reference Files:
Required Sections:
Allowed Write Targets:
Forbidden Files / Actions:
Token Budget: Low / Medium / High / Critical
Model Tier Recommendation: Light / Medium / Strong
Minimum Acceptable Model Tier: Light / Medium / Strong
Current Model Assessment: sufficient / acceptable with safeguards / stronger recommended / stronger required / split first

## 3. Model Capability Assessment

```text
Model Capability Assessment
Current Model: [name or "current runtime model"]
Task Complexity: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Required Reasoning: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Context Size: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Verification Difficulty: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
Historical Fit: [Good/Mixed/Weak/Unknown]
Recommended Model Tier: [Light/Medium/Strong]
Minimum Acceptable Model Tier: [Light/Medium/Strong]
Cost-Saving Option: [use weaker model / split task / reduce context / shorten output / not recommended]
User-Facing Recommendation Required: [Yes/No]
Decision: [sufficient / acceptable with safeguards / stronger recommended / stronger required / split]
Reason: [short reason]
Required Safeguards: [list]
User Approval Needed: Yes / No
Notes: [short notes]
```

Rules:
- Never claim a model is guaranteed or 100% capable.
- Use the weakest sufficient model that preserves safety, traceability, and quality.
- Ask the user about stronger models only when the risk, cost, or verification difficulty justifies it.

## 26. Client-Facing Application Proposal

This is not a text template but an **HTML document**. The proposal is generated as a self-contained HTML page with embedded CSS for professional presentation, RTL support, and print optimization.

Reference file: `tera-workshop/APPLICATION_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.html`

After the Client Discovery + Smart Interview process completes, Tera populates the template with:
- Application name, date, client name
- Problem and solution description
- Users, roles, and permissions
- Core MVP features and out-of-scope items
- Requirements by domain (functional, technical, data, design, security, ops)
- Assumptions table with status
- Proposed roadmap phases
- Approval section

The generated proposal is saved to:
- `clients/.../client-approval/` (external clients)
- `project-inputs/` (internal projects)

See `TERA_RUNTIME_PROTOCOLS.md` Section 18, Phase 7 for the protocol.

| `BusinessWorkflowAgent` | Business workflows (05) | Generate / Use Existing / Specialize | `05_BUSINESS_WORKFLOWS.md` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Agent Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Generate** | Agent does not exist — create from `AGENT_GENERATION_TEMPLATE.md` |
| **Use Existing** | Agent exists and is suitable — use directly |
| **Specialize** | Agent exists but is too generic — narrow sources/targets/constraints |

## 3. Agents Not Needed Now

| Agent | Reason | Defer Until |
|---|---|---|
| `SecurityAgent` | No sensitive data yet | Phase 5 or when auth is implemented |
| `DevOpsDeploymentAgent` | No deployment imminent | Before first deployment |
| ... | ... | ... |

## 4. Agent Generation Actions

| Agent | Action | Output File | Token Budget | Context Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RequirementsScopeAgent` | Generate | `generated-agents/opencode/RequirementsScopeAgent.md` | Medium | Task Context |
| `BusinessWorkflowAgent` | Specialize (exists) | Update existing file | Medium | Task Context |

| `05_BUSINESS_WORKFLOWS.md` | BusinessWorkflowAgent | `02_SCOPE_...`, `04_USERS_ROLES_...` | `project-preparation/05_BUSINESS_...` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 6. Activation Plan

| Agent | Activate Now? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `RequirementsScopeAgent` | Yes | Batch A: core scope files |
| `SolutionArchitectureAgent` | Yes | Batch A: technical architecture (parallel) |
| `BusinessWorkflowAgent` | No | Deferred until Batch C |

## 7. User Approval Points

| Point | What Needs Approval | Before Moving To |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Agent Generation Plan (this document) | Generating/activating agents |
| A2 | Activating agents in `.opencode/agents/` | Start of delegation |
| A3 | Scope files (01, 02) from first delegation batch | Remaining preparation files |

> **Rules:**
> - No approved PREPARATION_PLAN.md = No Sub-Agent Generation.
> - No generated/approved agent = No delegated preparation file.
> - No active need = No active sub-agent.

## 8. Approval Status

- [ ] Plan submitted
- [ ] Plan approved → Proceed to agent generation
